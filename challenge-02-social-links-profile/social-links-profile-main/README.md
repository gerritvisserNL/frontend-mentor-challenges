## My process

- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I first built the page myself, and later I asked ChatGPT to help me add semantic HTML5 markup. It suggested using elements like:

<main class="container"></main>
<section class="profile"></section>
<nav aria-label="social links"></nav>

Originally, I had created my navigation with only <div> elements, instead of the more semantic combination of <nav>, <ul>, and <li>.

Along the way, I also learned the difference between section. profile and section.profile in CSS:

section.profile (without a space) targets a <section> element that has the class profile.

section .profile (with a space) targets any element with the class profile that is a descendant of a <section>.

Another takeaway: I didnâ€™t need to use @media queries for this project.
