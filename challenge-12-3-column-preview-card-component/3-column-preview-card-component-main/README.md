### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to create a responsive card layout by switching from flexbox for mobile to CSS grid for desktop, using grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) to evenly distribute the columns. I discovered how to make all cards the same height and keep the button at the bottom of each card using margin-top: auto. Finally, I made the design more accessible by adding aria-labels to the buttons, ensuring a better experience for all users. Iâ€™m looking forward to using more CSS grid techniques in upcoming challenges to further improve my layouts.
