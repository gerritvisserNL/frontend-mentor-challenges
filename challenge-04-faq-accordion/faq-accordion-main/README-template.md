## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query
- reset.css

### What I learned

Defer: <script src="script.js" defer></script>

defer makes an external script execute only after the HTML is fully parsed, while the script is downloaded during parsing. This way, it doesnâ€™t block page rendering and you can safely access HTML elements in the script.
