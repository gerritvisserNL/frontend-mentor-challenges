### What I learned

Defer: <script src="script.js" defer></script>

defer makes an external script execute only after the HTML is fully parsed, while the script is downloaded during parsing. This way, it doesnâ€™t block page rendering and you can safely access HTML elements in the script.

In the FAQ example, :last-child did not work as expected because the last element inside the <dl> was a <dd> rather than a <dt>. As a result, the last question button was not selected. The correct solution is to use :last-of-type, which specifically targets the final <dt> and removes the border from its button.
