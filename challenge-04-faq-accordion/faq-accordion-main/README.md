## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query
- reset.css

### What I learned

I learned how to build a semantic FAQ using a <dl> (definition list), with questions in <dt> (term) and answers in <dd> (description). With JavaScript I toggle the 'hidden' attribute of the <dd>, update the attribute 'aria-expanded', and switch the icon between plus and minus. This way, the question opens or closes neatly on click.
