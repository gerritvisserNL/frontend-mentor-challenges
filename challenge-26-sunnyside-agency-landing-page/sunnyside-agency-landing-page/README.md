## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox & Grid

### What I learned

For the menu I created, I used line-height because I was using two different fonts. Line-height prevents the text from shifting when hovering over the link.

Instead of an if-else statement, I used a toggle function to switch between adding and removing a class (.hidden). To keep the script simple, the menu can be shown or hidden only by clicking the hamburger icon, not by clicking elsewhere on the screen.

To give the button an underline with rounded edges, I used the ::after pseudo-element.

Reminder: CSS Grid only applies to the direct children of the grid container element.
