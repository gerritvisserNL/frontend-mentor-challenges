### What I learned

In this challenge I practiced selecting elements from the DOM with querySelector and querySelectorAll.

I learned how to attach click event listeners to buttons and use a variable to store the selected rating.

I also updated the DOM by changing text with .textContent and toggling visibility with classList.add and classList.remove.

Using console.log for debugging helped me understand how values changed step by step. This project gave me more confidence in handling events, managing state and updating the DOM.
