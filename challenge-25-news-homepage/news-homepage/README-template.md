### What I learned

Reminder: ul.media-item means "select a <ul> element with the class media-item."

flex-shrink defines how much a flex item is allowed to shrink when there isn’t enough space in its flex container.

flex-shrink: 1; → the item can shrink (default).
flex-shrink: 0; → the item won’t shrink, it keeps its set width.
