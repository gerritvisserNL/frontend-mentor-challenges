## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query
- reset.css

### What I learned

Created a brand-new reset.css with the help of ChatGPT. A reset.css is needed to remove inconsistent default browser styles (like margins, paddings, or list bullets), so you start from a clean and consistent foundation across all browsers.

For the image in the header I made an image-wrapper and gave it the correct height and overflow: hidden. Used object-fit: cover to create a “zoom” effect.

I also learned the power of using rem units. By setting the html font-size in a media query (e.g. 20px at larger screens), every element defined in rem automatically scales up. This makes the design more consistent and responsive, without manually adjusting font-sizes and widths for each element.
