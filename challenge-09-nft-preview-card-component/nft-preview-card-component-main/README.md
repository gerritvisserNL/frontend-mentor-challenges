### What I learned

I learned that itâ€™s better to use a background image instead of an <img> tag because it gives more control over positioning, scaling, and hover effects. Using background-size: cover ensures the image fills the header, and background-position lets me choose which part is visible.

To make the header responsive, I used aspect-ratio, so the height adjusts automatically based on the width. This is much cleaner than setting a fixed height.

For hover effects, I used a ::after pseudo-element with content: "", position: absolute, and inset: 0. This creates a full overlay without adding extra HTML. Adding position: relative to the header makes sure the overlay and any absolute-positioned elements are correctly aligned. Then I applied a color overlay on hover using hsla() and a smooth transition for a fade effect.

Finally, I added a center icon that only appears on hover. I positioned it absolutely in the middle, set opacity: 0 by default, and on hover it fades in with opacity: 1. I even added a subtle scale effect so it feels interactive.
