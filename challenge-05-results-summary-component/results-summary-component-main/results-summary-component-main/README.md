### What I learned

In this project, I learned that semantically, the list of scores could be marked up using <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> instead of <ul> and <li>. The image or icon can be placed before the <dt> to visually match the original design while still maintaining proper semantic meaning.

I also discovered that adjusting the font-size on the body affects all rem units, making it easy to scale elements globally. However, for some of the design choices, I had to manually adjust components individually.

Additionally, using an <h1> for the main page title improves both accessibility and SEO, giving the page a clearer structure for users and search engines.
